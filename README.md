# Penguin Species Prediction 🐧

This project uses machine learning to classify **penguin species** (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap) based on physical measurements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Model training using classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in classifying penguin species.  

## 🔮 Future Work
- Feature importance analysis  
- Model deployment as an interactive web app
